# Project Summary: Online Food Eda & Prediction - Machine Learning

## Objective:-
The Goal Of This Project Is To Analyze And Predict Consumer Behavior Towards Online Food Services Using Machine Learning Techniques. By Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (Eda) On The "Onlinefoods" Dataset, We Aim To Derive Insights Related To User Demographics, Preferences, And Feedback, And Use This Information To Build A Predictive Model. This Model Will Help In Understanding The Factors That Influence Customer Satisfaction And Can Be Used To Predict Future Feedback Based On Different Variables.

### Dataset Overview:-
The Dataset, Named "Onlinefoods", Contains The Following Columns:
- **age**: Age Of The Consumer.
- **gender**: Gender Of The Consumer.
- **marital Status**: Marital Status Of The Consumer.
- **occupation**: Occupation Of The Consumer.
- **monthly Income**: Monthly Income Of The Consumer.
- **educational Qualifications**: The Highest Educational Qualification Of The Consumer.
- **family Size**: Number Of Family Members In The Household.
- **latitude**: Latitude Of The Consumer's Location.
- **longitude**: Longitude Of The Consumer's Location.
- **pin Code**: The Postal Code Of The Consumer's Location.
- **output**: Feedback/rating Provided By The Consumer On Their Online Food Service Experience (The Target Variable).
- **feedback**: Any Additional Text-based Feedback Given By The Consumer.

## Insights And Exploratory Data Analysis:-
1. **distribution Of Output**:-
   - This Analysis Provides An Overview Of How Consumer Feedback (Ratings) Is Distributed Across The Dataset. It Helps Understand Whether Most Consumers Tend To Rate The Food Services Highly Or If There Is A Skew Towards Lower Ratings.

2. **distribution Of Output By Gender**:-
   - This Analysis Investigates How Male And Female Consumers Differ In Their Feedback. It Identifies If There Are Any Significant Trends Or Patterns In Consumer Satisfaction Based On Gender.

3. **distribution Of Output By Marital Status**:-
   - Here, We Explore How Marital Status (E.g., Single Vs. Married) Correlates With Customer Satisfaction. It Provides Insights Into Whether Consumers With Different Relationship Statuses Tend To Rate The Food Service Differently.

4. **distribution Of Output By Occupation**:-
   - This Analysis Examines How Various Occupations (E.g., Professional, Student, Homemaker, Etc.) Influence Customer Feedback. By Understanding The Occupation-related Trends, Businesses Can Tailor Their Services For Different Consumer Segments.

5. **distribution Of Output By Educational Qualifications**:-
   - This Analysis Reveals How Consumer Feedback Varies According To Their Educational Background. It Helps Identify Whether Educated Consumers Tend To Give Higher Or Lower Ratings, And Can Provide Insights Into Their Expectations From Food Services.

## Machine Learning Objective:-
Beyond The Eda, The Primary Objective Is To Develop A Machine Learning Model That Predicts Consumer Feedback Based On The Other Demographic And Location-based Variables. Using Techniques Such As Regression Or Classification Algorithms, We Aim To Create A Model That Can Predict The Output (Feedback) Based On Features Such As Age, Gender, Occupation, And Income.

### Conclusion:-
The Project Provides A Comprehensive Analysis Of The "Onlinefoods" Dataset, Offering Valuable Insights Into How Different Demographic And Location-based Factors Affect Consumer Feedback. These Insights Can Be Leveraged By Online Food Service Providers To Understand Customer Preferences, Improve Their Services, And Tailor Their Marketing Strategies. Additionally, By Developing A Predictive Model, Businesses Can Anticipate Customer Feedback And Make Data-driven Decisions For Future Improvements.
